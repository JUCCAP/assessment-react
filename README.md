# React Frontend Developer Test Project

## Overview
This test project is designed to assess the skills and workflows that a frontend developer would use during a typical day at work. The main focus is on building a small React application that fetches and displays a list of items from an API and allows the user to perform basic interactions.

## Project Description

### Objective
Create a React application that displays a list of books. The user should be able to add a book to the list and remove a book from the list. The application should have a simple but clean user interface.

### Requirements

1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize the project with Create React App.
   - Use functional components and hooks.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Fetch the initial list of books from a public API (e.g., [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)).
   - Implement functionalities to add and remove books from the list. For simplicity, these changes do not need to be persisted on the server.

3. **State Management:**
   - Use React context or Redux for state management across the application.

4. **Styling:**
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling the application.
   - Ensure the application is responsive and provides a good user experience on mobile devices.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Properly handle and display errors from the API to the user.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your components using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Optional Enhancements
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the list of books.
- Add a search feature to filter books by title or author.
- Use TypeScript for type-safety and to improve the development experience.

## Workflow

1. **Development:**
   - Clone the repository and create a new branch for your feature.
   - Develop the feature as per the requirements.

2. **Pull Request (PR):**
   - Once the feature is complete, push your branch and create a pull request to the `main` branch.
   - Ensure that your PR description summarizes the changes and any important information needed to understand your solution.

3. **Code Review:**
   - Request a code review from your peers.
   - Attend the code review session and discuss your approach, answer questions, and provide feedback on other's code as well.

4. **Revision:**
   - Address any feedback from the code review and make necessary changes to your code.
   - Once all feedback has been addressed, merge the PR into the `main` branch.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code organization and clarity.
- Adherence to React best practices.
- Quality of the user interface and user experience.
- Completeness and robustness of tests.
- Handling of edge cases and errors.
- Effective use of version control and PR practices.
